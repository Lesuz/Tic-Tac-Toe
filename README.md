# Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe web app using React 
This project was done by following a tutorial made by Tom Bowden on Udemy. The app was made using React with React Hooks, and some basing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## How to play

There are two players: 'X' and 'O' .
'X' starts the game by placing their sign onto one of the nine available squares.
Next 'O' places their sign onto one of the eight remaining squares and so on.
The first player to have three sign in a roq, column or a diagonial line wins the game and the game end.
If the players want to play again, reload the page.
